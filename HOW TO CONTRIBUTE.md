In order to contribute to ReachVariantTool, you'll need to set up your build environment:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community
* [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2019) plug-in
* Qt version 5.15.2, 64-bit, for MSVC 2019 x64.

  [You'll need to set that up in the Qt VS plug-in.](https://doc.qt.io/qtvstools/qtvstools-managing-projects.html#managing-qt-versions) When setting it up, you'll need to select names for the Qt versions; the names used for ReachVariantTool are `5.15.2 MSVC2019 x64`.

Anyone wishing to contribute their changes to the main ReachVariantTool project must also agree to [the contributor license agreement](https://gist.github.com/DavidJCobb/cbbac4f8afadfc40cde8ec862ce20bc6) before contributing. This license agreement serves three purposes:

* It permits this project to use your code contributions under GPLv3.

* It permits this project to use your contributions to the content of the help manual (e.g. text and images) under CC0.

* You promise that you're legally allowed to share your contributions with this project (i.e. it's your content or you have the rights to it; your employer doesn't own it as part of your contract with them; et cetera).

GitHub has an equivalent clause in their Terms of Service (when contributing to a repo, you agree to license your contribution under the same license(s) as the repo), but I would prefer to make this explicit, rather than relying on a couple paragraphs buried in a Terms of Service agreement that a corporation can change at any time without warning.

The help manual's contents are under CC0 so that people can share excerpts, etc., without having to bundle the source XML for the manual or the systems used to produce friendly, readable web pages from that source XML. Everything else is under GPLv3, which stipulates that:

* Users can redistribute the program without having to ask for permission.
* Users can create their own forks of the program without having to ask for permission.
* People distributing the program (or a fork) must include the license information, so that users know what rights they have.
* People distributing the program (or a fork) must ensure that others can access the source code, so that users can exercise those rights.

It's my understanding that any original content (i.e. content wholly created or owned by you) that you license to this project under GPLv3 remains yours. People can take that content from this repo and use it under the terms of GPLv3, but you can still share that content with other parties, or use it in your own works, under any license you wish, without any interference from this project or its maintainers.
