NOTES:
 - There are thirteen skulls available per round
 - The struct that we call GameVariantHeader is also used for map variants; refer to our 
   map variant JS prototype for full details and branches; we should amend our source 
   code to reflect this.
 - Turn Count is implemented via the Number of Rounds setting:
    - No Limit   = 1 round
    - One Each   = 2 rounds
    - Two Each   = 4 rounds
    - Three Each = 6 rounds


OBSERVATIONS FROM TESTING:
 - If teams are enabled, then the only thing they influence is player spawn locations. 
   Your team species determines what loadouts you get, whether you're allied with the 
   Covenant NPCs, and whether you can earn points for killing them (no, if you're an 
   Elite).
   
   If teams are disabled, then all players are enemies of the Covenant NPCs, regardless 
   of their species; however, Elites still neither earn nor lose points for killing 
   them.

 - Indestructible Vehicles does not apply to Covenant vehicles spawned during the 
   match.
   
    - TODO: Test the Rocket Warthog on Beachhead.

 - Vehicle Set does not apply to vehicles that spawn during the match. Unknown if it 
   would apply to pre-placed onces.
   
    - TODO: Test the Rocket Warthog on Beachhead.

 - The "X on Map" flags don't work; they're all cleared by default, but Turrets on Map 
   being cleared doesn't prevent Overlook's turret from spawning.

 - Respawn Traits work.

 - The Round Time Limit option available in Custom Games works, and limits the length 
   of the entire match.
   
    - The Round Limit option is used as the "backend" for the Turn Count option, which 
      means that Firefight "rounds" are a separate concept from (and a subordinate 
      concept to) "rounds" in general.

 - Custom Game base-player traits work and presumably apply to all players, beneath 
   the Firefight-specific per-species base traits.

 - If a wave fails to spawn any enemies (either because all squad types were None, or 
   because none of the squad types were available on the current map), then it will 
   end instantly. If dropships are enabled, then "instantly" means that the next wave 
   will begin once the dropships have departed the map. If dropships are disabled, 
   then the wave ends after seven seconds. Note that if map hazards produce any 
   enemies (e.g. drop pods, or Beachhead's Wraiths and Ghosts), those will count 
   towards the wave spawning enemies, meaning that the wave will not be skipped.
   
   Sadly, multiplayer and the presence of player-Elites doesn't appear to affect this; 
   if a perfect recreation of Network Test 1 is possible, it will take more than just 
   setting the squad types to None (or the squad count to 0, for that matter). Moreover, 
   new waves will still reset a dead Covenant player's respawn time, and since the 
   default spawn time is 10 seconds and waves end in 7, that means that a Covenant 
   player killed during a round won't respawn until it ends.
   
    - UPDATE: Examination of the map script establishes that it's actually nine seconds, 
      not seven.

 - The "Squad Count" option on waves doesn't allow you to change the number of squads 
   that Firefight uses for any given wave; it just changes the number of squads in the 
   game variant that are flagged as "defined." If you set all squad types in an initial 
   wave to "None" and then change the Squad Count to 1, then you'll see 1 empty squad 
   and 2 squads of Brutes (which are the value 0).

 - If the Iron Skull is enabled for a non-bonus round, and all Spartans die yet still 
   have lives remaining, then they will be unable to respawn (of course) but the round 
   will not end (nor the match overall). This is a softlock.
   
   Disabling Iron Skull for the bonus round seems to prevent the endless enemy spawning?



NETWORK TEST 1 RECREATION NOTES:

 - Dead players' respawn timers are reset when a new wave begins. If we enable dropships, 
   then we can at least increase wave durations long enough that this doesn't completely 
   prevent players from respawning at all. Base Wave Traits appear to affect dropships' 
   turrets: making them blind and deaf will prevent them from ever attacking anyone.
   
   Dead players' respawn timers being reset *at all* isn't ideal, however; the announcer 
   calling "Reinforcements!" on each new wave isn't ideal either. Moreover, the constantly 
   advancing waves cause weapon drops to occur roughly every 35 seconds as new rounds 
   begin.

 - In theory, the bonus wave could be used to ensure a single span of time during which 
   no new waves will begin. The max bonus wave duration allowed by the file format is 
   4095 seconds, which is well above the 5 minutes we'd need to recreate Network Test 1. 
   The problem is that without dropships, it takes about 105 seconds to get to the bonus 
   wave, during which time dead players will be effectively unable to respawn. With 
   dropships, it would take about ten minutes to get to the bonus wave.
   
   Another issue is that the bonus round instantly ends if all Spartans die, even if the 
   Iron Skull is disabled.
