The following objects can be matched with for-each-object triggers:

 - Dead bipeds, their equipped armor ability, and their dropped weapons and grenades. 
   Notably, grenades dropped by players have a different default waypoint color (one 
   which implies team ownership or alliance status) than ambient grenades (which use 
   a neutral grey).

 - Hologram bipeds (object type differs from Spartan, Elite, and Monitor)

 - Weapons integrated into any multi-seat vehicle, as well as the weapon integrated 
   into a shade. (Weapons for single-seat vehicles such as Ghosts have not been 
   observed to react to for-each-object loops.) The objects in question continue to 
   exist even when the owning vehicle is destroyed.

 - Some, but not all, vehicle debris objects, e.g. the detached wheels of a destroyed 
   Warthog.

 - The stand for a newly-detached Machine Gun Turret or Plasma Cannon. These stands 
   do not test as equivalent to the turrets' own object types. (Detaching a Plasma 
   Cannon while using it will destroy the stand; however, detaching it by damaging 
   it will leave the stand intact and iterable.)

 - Powerups and Jersey Barriers.

 - Some Forge rocks on Breakpoint and Tempest.

 - The radio boxes on Boardwalk, Boneyard, Tempest, etc..

 - Forge Teleporter Receiver Nodes, but not Two-Way Nodes. These nodes don't match 
   the "teleporter" types in the object type list as of this writing.

 - Forgeable Man Cannons on Tempest.

 - Forgeable (Soft) Safe and Kill Boundaries.

 - Those weird objects on Boneyard that show up in Forge and look like Respawn Zones, 
   but can't be edited. This includes both the ones actually in the map and the ones 
   that line the map boundaries.

 - The flourescent lights above some doors in Boneyard.

 - Several invisible objects embedded inside or just past the western portion of 
   Boneyard's southern wall (for reference, the cliffs are the northern boundary).


The following objects can be matched with for-each-object-with-label triggers that use 
an appropriately configured label, though the precise operational definition of "appro-
priately configured" is yet to be determined. Forge labels with no names, set to point 
to a team, seem to work. Some of these objects may also be iterable with for-each-
object loops (and have been marked accordingly); I can only run so many tests in so 
much time.

 - Rockets fired from a rocket launcher or from a Rocket Warthog

 - Plasma rounds fired from a plasma launcher, both in flight and on a surface

 - Grenades fired from a grenade launcher, whether EMP or plain

 - Fuel rods fired from a Banshee

 - Mortars fired from a Revenant or Wraith

 - Charged shots from a Plasma Pistol, but not normal shots

 - Thrown grenades (though they do not test as equivalent to the grenade object types, 
   i.e. a "thrown plasma grenade" is not a "plasma grenade")

 - Folding chairs and camping stools [TODO: for-each-object?]

 - Propane tanks [TODO: for-each-object?]

 - Crates [TODO: for-each-object?]

 - The animated generators on Breakpoint, and the front windows for the Research 
   Station building. An unknown object embedded in the rock between the Upper Tunnel 
   and Lower Tunnel. An unknown object embedded in the ceiling of the Main Tunnel's 
   northwest-side corner room.


The following objects are not iterable through any means:

 - Rounds fired from a Concussion Rifle

 - Rounds fired from any needle weapon

 - Rounds fired from any bullet weapon
