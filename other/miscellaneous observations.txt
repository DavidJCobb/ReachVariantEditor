If a player is forced into a Monitor biped and then given a weapon, they will be able 
to fire that weapon if it is a ranged weapon, and they will be able to swap it out 
with any other weapon. Ranged weapons can do damage and kill, though this may only be 
true on host.

If a player is forced into a Monitor biped, they will automatically pick up any grenades 
or armor abilities they fly over, but they will be unable to use them. The armor ability 
will be visible on the Monitor's body as if it were attached rather than picked up (i.e. 
the little holographic image is still visible).

A Monitor-player can pick up a detached machine gun turret, but not use an attached one.

If one biped is attached to the other, the attached biped will stop simulating physics, 
and it will rotate with its "parent." Looking up or down pitches whatever bone the biped 
is attached to.

If two widgets have the same screen position, they will align intelligently rather than 
overlapping.
