# ReachVariantTool
 
A tool for editing Halo: Reach game variants, tested on files obtained from Halo: The Master Chief Collection's PC release.

You can download the program [from NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/halothemasterchiefcollection/mods/192/).

The repo has a few top-level folders. The "html" folder was for some prototyping I did in JavaScript, to quickly get a handle on reading Reach's bit-aligned data, and is provided as a reference for other developers wishing to research or create content for Halo: Reach. The "native" folder is for the main program.

## Contributing

This program was built using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 with the [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2019) plug-in and with Qt Designer. The [version of Qt used](https://doc.qt.io/qtvstools/qtvstools-managing-projects.html#managing-qt-versions) was 5.12.5, 64-bit, for MSVC 2017.
