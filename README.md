# ReachVariantEditor
 
A tool for editing Halo: Reach game variants, tested on files obtained from Halo: The Master Chief Collection's PC release.

You can download the program [from NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/halothemasterchiefcollection/mods/192/).

This tool was built using Visual Studio 2019. It dynamically links Qt, which was licensed under LGPLv3, and it incorporates some Halo: Reach gametype icons per Microsoft's Game Content Usage Rules (see README.txt for further attribution).

The repo has a few top-level folders: the "html" folder was for some prototyping I did in JavaScript, to quickly get a handle on reading Reach's bit-aligned data; the "native" folder is for the main program.
