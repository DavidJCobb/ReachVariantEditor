         NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY:
         
          - Word: Any token that isn't a delimiter or operator. Function names, variable and 
            property names like player[0].number[1], numeric constants, and keywords are all 
            words.
            
          - Block: A container for expressions. This can include code blocks, but in our 
            parser the list of conditions for an if-block is also, itself, a non-nestable 
            block.
            
          - Call Stem: The name of a function; any word that precedes a parentheses-delimited 
            expression.
            
          - Expression Joiner: The keywords "or" and "and", used to link multiple conditions 
            within a single if-statement. For ease of parsing, these are considered special 
            and are not allowed as general operators. (The bitwise operators are & and |. 
            Native booleans don't exist in Megalo and must be implemented on top of integer 
            types, so boolean operators don't exist either.)
         
         OTHER NOTES:
         
          - Though our syntax is inspired by Lua, we allow compound-assignment operators such 
            as plus-equals and minus-equals; this is so that assignment matches up with the 
            "modify variable" Megalo opcode as closely as possible.
         
          - The "alias" statement allows you to alias a variable name or integer constant; 
            this is helpful since variables must otherwise be referred to by their raw names, 
            like "player[0].number[4]". You can alias top-level variables (e.g. "player[0]"), 
            nested variables (e.g. "player.number[4]", allowing "player[0].alias_name"), and 
            options.
            
            The assignment operator respects aliasing; "alias_name = value" writes to the 
            underlying variable rather than rebinding aliases. Aliases are roughly analogous 
            to references in C++.
            
             - One of the things I intend to do with aliases is, during decompilation, auto-
               generate aliases for script options at the start of the file, mangling the 
               option names as needed (e.g. "Alpha Zombies" -> "option_alpha_zombies"). We 
               can do the same for player traits.
         
          - The "expect" declaration can only be used in functions; it places constraints on 
            what a caller must do before calling the function. Specifically, functions can't 
            return a value and must instead operate on a specific global variable, expecting 
            their caller to appropriately prepare and use that variable. For example, Alpha 
            Zombies has a function to count the number of survivors; this function uses the 
            global.number[0] variable to hold its result and it expects that that variable 
            will have been set to zero prior to the call. The "expect" declaration is meant 
            to enforce this as a compile-time directive (though I don't know that I'll be 
            able to implement that in practice; we'll see).
      
         TODO:
         
         Add the entry types for triggers: normal, subroutine, init, local init, host migrat-
         ion, object death, local, and pre-game. Not sure how we want to represent those in 
         the syntax yet, though.
         
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
         Add an extract_string_literal(text, i) function which searches for a string literal 
         (single-line or multi-line) at the given point and returns it if found. (In C++, it 
         would return a bool indicating presence and write to a std::string& argument.) We 
         want the parser to be able to understand string literals it finds, but we also need 
         the "for each object with label" handling to be able to "demand" a string literal at 
         a specific point, so it's best to have a single "extract" function -- or better yet: 
         a "find and extract" function that skips over whitespace but not anything else.
         
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
         If we convert this from a single function to a state object with methods, then we can 
         move the handling for each keywords out from the main "parse" function and into other 
         member functions; parse state will be held as members on the state object, so other 
         member functions would be able to access it. This will keep the code shorter and more 
         organized, which will be especially helpful in C++.
         
         We should also have "extract_word" and "find_and_extract_word" member functions. We 
         currently have one function to extract (used during the parse loop) and one function 
         to find (used during keyword handling, followed by manual code to extract), and we'll 
         never want to find and *not* extract the next word from the script code.
         
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
         We should endeavor to store location information on blocks, statements, and so on. 
         This would allow us to do three things:
         
          - Smart re-parsing: if we know that the user has only edited content within a block, 
            then we only have to re-parse that block. This can optimize syntax highlighting.
         
          - Friendly displays: I hope to add an overlay that activates when the cursor is set 
            within any given statement; this overlay would display the statement in plain 
            English, with drop-downs and textboxes as appropriate to allow editing the opcode.
         
          - In turn, keeping metadata about where a token came from would make it easier to 
            replace tokens when the user makes changes via the friendly displays.
         
         It would also make error reporting easier, both at parse time and when going back 
         through the parsed data to check for other errors (e.g. assigning to a constant or to 
         a read-only value like a script option, which wouldn't cause a parse error).
         
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
         Use the "parseExpression" test as the basis of our parser. Instead of sepearating 
         ParsedExpressions after the fact, separate them in real-time. Make ParsedExpression 
         handle both parentheses and blocks, and set things up so we split from the current 
         ParsedExpression to a new sibling during parsing when...
         
          - string | string
          
             = To explain: when we encounter a space, we don't store that in the expression; 
               instead, we tell the expression that the next text we append (if any) should 
               not be attached to the current text. So "a + b" is stored as ("a", "+", "b") 
               and not ("a ", "+", " b"). This means that "a b" is stored as ("a", "b"), and 
               so two consecutive string entries means a space separating two pieces of text. 
               In mimicry of Lua we interpret this as a statement separator.
               
               TODO: Line breaks and tabs need to also count as spaces, in this regard.
          
          - ParsedExpression | string
          
          - string | ParsedExpression
          
          - ParsedCallStem, ParsedExpression | string not prefixed with "."
          
          - ParsedCallStem, ParsedExpression | ParsedExpression
          
          - Block keywords (do, else, elseif, function, end, for, if, then)
          
          - Other keywords (alias, expect)
          
         And error when...
         
          - ParsedOperator, ParsedOperator
         
         The parser should keep an eye out for keywords and treat them accordingly (i.e. the 
         "or" and "and" keywords separate expressions into siblings within a condition; the 
         "for" and similar keywords mark the start of a block, possibly with additional data). 
         We should maintain not just variables for the current expression, but also: blockRoot, 
         blockCurrent, exprRoot, and exprCurrent.
