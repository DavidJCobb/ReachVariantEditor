```megalo-bolt
-- [Non-Fatal] Assignment expressions are not allowed in alias value expressions.
alias foo = a = b
```

```megalo-bolt
-- [Non-Fatal] Assignment expressions are not allowed in alias value expressions.
-- [Non-Fatal] Cannot assign a value to a literal.
-- [Non-Fatal] Suspicious pair of errors: this may actually be a syntax error; error messages past this point may be incorrect.
alias foo = 3 = b
```


== Function call ==

```megalo-bolt
-- [Non-Fatal] Function "game.not_send_incident" does not exist. Did you mean one of the following?
--              - game.send_incident(incident, player-or-group, player-or-group)
game.not_send_incident(respawn_beep, no_player, no_team)

-- Unrecognized function identifiers should show suggestions that match the call signature used. 
-- Given that we're adding named parameters and default parameters to Bolt, this may require 
-- some "fuzzy" matching.
