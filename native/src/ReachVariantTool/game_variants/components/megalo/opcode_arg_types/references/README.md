This folder consisted of experiments at trying to reimplement how RVT handles references [1]. However, I don't think I can easily write new code that fits cleanly into RVT's very old codebase. Frankly, I've gotten a lot better as a coder since I built, like, *any* of this, and the old code's design is such that it's extremely difficult to rewrite any one component in isolation.

This entire folder has been Excluded From Project so that the program can still build. Nothing inside of it ever got off the ground, and I'll likely delete it in a future commit once I've created at least some record of it. Code like this could be useful if I just... straight-up rewrite RVT's entire backend *and* compiler from scratch.
