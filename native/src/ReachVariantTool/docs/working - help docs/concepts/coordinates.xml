         Different video games (and 3D graphics engines generally) have different conventions 
         for how rotations are stored, what Euler angles actually mean, and what the different 
         3D axes actually mean. For example, in Skyrim, an object's local Y-axis is its forward 
         axis, but in Halo: Reach, an object's local X-axis is its forward axis.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         <li>
            The X-axis represents "forward" and the Z-axis represents "up."
         </li>
         <li>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
