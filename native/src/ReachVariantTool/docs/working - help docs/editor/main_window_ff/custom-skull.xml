      <p>
         <dfn>Skulls</dfn> are special gameplay modifiers that can be switched on and 
         off. A Firefight round can use any of the game's original Campaign skulls, as 
         well as any or all of three custom skulls: Red, Blue, and Yellow.
      </p>

         Each Custom Skull offers a set of <a href="traits">player traits</a> for 
         Spartans and Elites each, as well as a set of <a href="traits-wave">wave traits</a> 
         for NPCs.
