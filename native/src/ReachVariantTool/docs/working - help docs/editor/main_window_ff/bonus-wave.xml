         The <b>bonus wave</b> page allows you to control which skulls are enabled 
         during a Firefight bonus wave, and what enemy types spawn during the wave.

         Skulls and wave configuration work the same way as for <a href="round">rounds</a>. 
         Additionally, you can configure the bonus wave's duration in seconds. The value 
         "disabled" replaces zero; to disable the bonus wave, set the duration to "1 second" 
         and then decrease it by one.
