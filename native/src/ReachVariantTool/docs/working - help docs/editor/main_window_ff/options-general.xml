         The fields available to edit are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Teams Enabled</dt>
            <dd>Controls whether teams are enabled.</dd>
         <dt>Player Species</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>Determines whether players play as Spartans or Elites. It should be 
               noted that <a href="/concepts/firefight">in team games, a player's species 
               is what controls basically all team behavior, rather than the actual team 
               that the player is on</a>. The available values are:</p>
               <dl>
                  <dt>Player Preference</dt>
                     <dd>Players will spawn as the biped they've selected in their 
                     customization options.</dd>
                  <dt>All Spartans</dt>
                     <dd>Player customization will be ignored, and players will 
                     always spawn as Spartans.</dd>
                  <dt>All Elites</dt>
                     <dd>Player customization will be ignored, and players will 
                     always spawn as Elites.</dd>
                  <dt>Use Team Species</dt>
                     <dd>Player customization will be ignored, and players will spawn 
                     as the species set up in their team's 
                     <a href="options-team-specific.html">individual configuration.</a></dd>
                  <dt>Spartans vs Elites</dt>
                     <dd>The "defense" team will be Spartans, and the "offense" team 
                     will be Elites.</dd>
               </dl>
            </dd>
         <dt>Round Time Limit</dt>
            <dd>The maximum amount of time that a round can last. The value "no limit" 
            exists in place of zero (i.e. to reach it, decrease the value to "1 minute" 
            and then decrease it again).</dd>
         <dt>Number of Rounds</dt>
            <dd>The maximum number of rounds that a match can have. The value "no limit" 
            exists in place of zero (i.e. to reach it, decrease the value to "1 round" 
            and then decrease it again).</dd>
         <dt>Sudden Death Time</dt>
            <dd>How long Sudden Death lasts, in game variants that use it. Sudden 
            Death is "bonus time" granted to players if someone is near or using an 
            objective object (e.g. carrying a flag) when the round time runs out.</dd>
         <dt>Grace Period</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>How long the Grace Period lasts, in game variants that use it. If 
               the conditions needed to trigger Sudden Death stop before the Sudden Death 
               time limit is reached, then the Grace Period is how long players have to 
               reinstate those conditions before the round ends.</p>
               <p>For example, in Capture the Flag, if an attacker is standing on top of 
               the flag when the round time limit is reached, then they will be granted 
               Sudden Death time. If the attacker is killed before Sudden Death runs out, 
               then Sudden Death will stop and the Grace Period timer will begin. If the 
               attackers reach the flag within that time, then Sudden Death will continue 
               from where it left off, while the Grace Period resets.</p>
            </dd>
      </dl>
      
      <h2>Fields hidden by default</h2>
      <p>
         Firefight files contain the same set of Custom Game options as normal Multiplayer 
         game variants, but not all of these options are functional. By default, 
         ReachVariantTool will hide Firefight settings that are known to be non-functional. 
         Those settings include:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Perfection Medal Enabled</dt>
            <dd>Controls whether it is possible to earn a Perfection Medal in this game 
            variant. Bungie and 343 Industries only enable this for pure Slayer variants; 
            even Flag Slayer keeps it disabled.</dd>
         <dt>Reset Players on New Round (unused)</dt>
            <dd>A non-functional leftover. Presumably, this setting would have let you 
            control whether players' weapons, health, or other states were reset with 
            every new round.</dd>
         <dt>Reset Map on New Round (unused)</dt>
            <dd>A non-functional leftover from <i>Halo 2</i>. In the past, this option 
            let you control whether a map's objects and state were reset with every new 
            round, but testing suggests that it doesn't work in <i>Halo: Reach</i>.</dd>
         <dt>Rounds to Win</dt>
            <dd>Presumably the number of rounds that a single player or team must win 
            to win a match early. Testing is pending.</dd>
