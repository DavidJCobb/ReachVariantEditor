   <title>Respawn Settings</title>
   <body>
      <p>
         The <b>respawn settings</b> page allows you to edit settings related to how 
         players respawn. Spartan players and Elite players each have their own set 
         of respawn settings.

      <p>
         The fields available to edit are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Respawn with Teammate (unverified)</dt>
            <dd>Unknown. Testing failed to identify any obvious effect.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn at Location (unverified)</dt>
            <dd>Unknown. Testing failed to identify any obvious effect.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn on Kills</dt>
            <dd>Testing is pending.</dd>
         <dt>Team Lives per Round</dt>
            <dd>Presumably controls the maximum number of lives available to a team as 
            a whole; testing is pending. The value "unlimited" exists in place of zero (i.e. 
            to reach it, decrease the value to "1 life" and then decrease it again).</dd>
         <dt>Respawn Time</dt>
            <dd>The baseline delay between dying and respawning, for all players. Unlike 
            normal Multiplayer, Firefight enforces a minimum respawn time of 3 seconds.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn Traits Duration</dt>
            <dd>Controls how long players have Respawn Traits after respawning.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <h2>Fields hidden by default</h2>
      <p>
         Firefight files contain the same set of Custom Game options as normal Multiplayer 
         game variants, but not all of these options are functional. By default, 
         ReachVariantTool will hide Firefight settings that are known to be non-functional. 
         Those settings include:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Synchronize with Team</dt>
            <dd>Controls whether player respawn timers run independently or synchronize 
            with those of their teammates.</dd>
         <dt>Lives per Round</dt>
            <dd>Controls the maximum number of times a player can die before they are 
            unable to respawn again. The value "unlimited" exists in place of zero (i.e. 
            to reach it, decrease the value to "1 life" and then decrease it again).</dd>
         <dt>Suicide Penalty</dt>
            <dd>The number of seconds added to the delay on a player's next spawn, if 
            they died by their own hand or were killed by a level boundary.</dd>
         <dt>Betrayal Penalty</dt>
            <dd>The number of seconds added to the delay on a player's next spawn, if 
            they have killed a teammate.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn Time Growth</dt>
            <dd>Every time a player dies, their respawn time increases by this amount. 
            If a player kills an enemy, their respawn time will decrease by this amount, 
            though it will not fall below the base respawn time.</dd>
         <dt>Loadout Camera Time</dt>
            <dd>A delay between the start of the match and the first time players spawn 
            in. This delay encompasses the initial black screen with a scoreboard, the 
            fade in, and the display of the Initial Loadout Camera view (during which 
            time players can select a loadout).</dd>
