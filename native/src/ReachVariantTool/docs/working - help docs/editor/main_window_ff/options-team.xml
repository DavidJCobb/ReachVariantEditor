         The fields available to edit are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Team Scoring Method</dt>
            <dd>Unknown. This may be related to the oldest Halo games' options to 
            control how a team's score was computed from the scores of its players, 
            but testing is pending. <i>Halo: Reach</i> official files seem to use 
            the value 0.</dd>
         <dt>Designator Switch Type</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>This option controls how teams are remapped across rounds, but the 
               meanings of its values are unknown.</p>
               <p>After each round in a match, teams will swap places; for example, in 
               offense/defense game variants with two teams, each team will take turns 
               playing the "defense" role.</p>
