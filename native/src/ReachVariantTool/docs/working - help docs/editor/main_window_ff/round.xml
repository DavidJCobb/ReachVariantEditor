   <title>Round Settings</title>
   <body>
      <p>
         The <b>round settings</b> page allows you to control which skulls are enabled 
         during a Firefight round, and what enemy types spawn during the round's waves.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Skulls</h2>
      <p>
         <dfn>Skulls</dfn> are special gameplay modifiers that can be switched on and 
         off. A Firefight round can use any of the game's original Campaign skulls, as 
         well as any or all of three <a href="custom-skull">custom skulls</a> with 
         user-configurable effects.
      </p>

            <dd>When a Grunt is killed with a headshot, confetti explodes outward from

            <dd>Prevents killed players from respawning, even if they have lives remaining. 
            <strong>This skull should only be enabled for the Bonus Wave.</strong> Other 
            waves will not end (in a Spartan defeat or otherwise) if all Spartans are dead 
            but still have lives remaining, which means that enabling the Iron Skull for 
            normal rounds can cause softlocks.</dd>

      <h2>Waves</h2>
      <p>
         A Firefight round has five waves: one Initial Wave, three Main Waves, and one Boss 
         Wave. For each wave, the game will select one enemy squad type from those available, 
         and spawn six of that squad.
      </p>
      <img src="round-wave.png" />
      <p>
         The following settings are configurable for each type of wave:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Uses Dropships</dt>
            <dd>If enabled, enemies will be transported into the playable space by Phantom 
            or Spirit dropships. If disabled, enemies will spawn inside the map, typically 
            out in the open (though maps like Corvette spawn them in locked areas instead).</dd>
         <dt>Squad Order</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>Controls whether the game cycles through squad types or picks them at random.</p>
               <p>
                  Here's an interesting question: How does "ordered squads" interact with the 
                  squad type list when the number of squad types exceeds the number of times 
                  that the wave configuration will actually be used? For example, Main Waves 
                  typically define five squads, but there are only three Main Waves in any 
                  given round. Does that mean that the last two squads will never be used? 
                  Well, no. Each <a href="/concepts/firefight#overall-match-flow">set</a> cycles the starting 
                  point. Let's use Round 1 as an example, and assume that all wave types are 
                  set to use ordered squads.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In Set 1, Round 1 will use: Initial Wave squad 1; Main Wave squads 1, 2, and 
                  3; and Boss Wave squad 1.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In Set 2, Round 1 will use: Initial Wave squad 2; Main Wave squads 2, 3, and 
                  4; and Boss Wave squad 2.
               </p>
            </dd>
         <dt>Squad Count</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>
                  This setting appears to control the number of your chosen squad types that 
                  the game engine will pay attention to. The game engine will always spawn only 
                  six squads (all of the same type) on the map per wave; it will also always use 
                  at least three squad types for Initial Waves and Boss Waves, and at least five 
                  squad types for Main Waves. However, if the Squad Count is lower than the number 
                  of squad types that the game engine will use, then the remaining squad types 
                  will be Brutes instead of the ones you've specified.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As an example, if you set an Initial Wave's first three squad types to Grunts, 
                  but you also set the Squad Count to 1, then the game will act as if the squad 
                  types that it has to choose from are Grunts, Brutes, and Brutes.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Why Brutes? They're encoded as the number zero, and computers typically use zero 
                  to mean a default, or to mean the first thing in a list of possibilities.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Currently, it is recommended that you leave this option at its default for the 
                  respective wave type &mdash; again, 3 for Initial and Boss Waves, and 5 for Main 
                  Waves.
