      <p>
         The <b>option visibility</b> page allows you to prevent users from editing 
         the values of certain options via the in-game menus. As an example, the 
         official Assault gametype uses this data to prevent players from disabling 
         teams, since there is no code to handle FFA Assault.

         In the original Xbox 360 version of <i>Halo: Reach</i>, a "disabled" option 
         is visible in the menus but greyed out, while a "hidden" option doesn't show 
         up in the menus at all. In Halo: The Master Chief Collection, disabled and 
         hidden options are both completely hidden from the menus.

      <p>
         The top pane of the option visibility page allows you to control whether 
         script-specific settings are accessible, while the bottom pane allows you to 
         control whether non-script-specific options are accessible. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Both panes support multi-selection, and both panes have a context menu that 
         allows you to change the states of all selected options. Selecting a category 
         of settings (e.g. "Player Traits") is equivalent to selecting all of the 
         options in that category.
      </p>
      <p>
         There are over a thousand checkboxes for non-script-specific options. The 
         vast majority of these are unknown: we do not know what options they actually 
         correspond to: they may not correspond to options that are in the in-game 
         menus, or they may correspond to options from other game modes (e.g. Firefight).
