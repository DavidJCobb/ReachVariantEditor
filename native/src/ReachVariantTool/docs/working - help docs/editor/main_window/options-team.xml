      <p>
         The <b>team settings</b> page allows you to edit settings related to team scoring 
         and configuration. To edit settings for individual teams, refer to 
         <a href="options-team-specific.html">this page</a>.

         The fields available to edit are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Team Scoring Method</dt>
            <dd>Unknown. This may be related to the oldest Halo games' options to 
            control how a team's score was computed from the scores of its players, 
            but testing is pending. <i>Halo: Reach</i> official files seem to use 
            the value 0.</dd>
         <dt>Designator Switch Type</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>This option controls how teams are remapped across rounds, but the 
               meanings of its values are unknown.</p>
               <p>After each round in a match, teams will swap places; for example, in 
               offense/defense game variants with two teams, each team will take turns 
               playing the "defense" role. The game engine takes care of this behavior 
               by remapping teams internally: the gametype script always treats "Red 
               Team" (or <code>team[0]</code> internally) as Defense, and the game 
               engine just lies about which team <em>is</em> "Red Team."</p>
               <p>This option, then, would presumably determine how teams are remapped. 
               However, it is impossible to fully test its meanings without gathering 
               up eight people to play game variants in-game.</p>
