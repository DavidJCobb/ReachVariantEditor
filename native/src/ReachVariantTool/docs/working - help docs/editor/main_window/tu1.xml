         The fields available to edit are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Shield Bleedthrough</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether damage "bleeds through" player shields. For example, 
            if you have 5 points of shields and are hit with an attack that does 10 
            points of damage, bleedthrough would result in you losing all of your 
            shields as well as 5 points of health, while a lack of bleedthrough would 
            result in you losing your shields but not losing any health (i.e. you 
            receive 5 points of damage and the other 5 points are discarded).</dd>
         <dt>Activating Armor Lock doesn't shed stuck grenades</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether activating Armor Lock will cause you to shed any 
            grenades that have been stuck to you, preventing them from killing you.</dd>
         <dt>Armor Lock can be stuck with plasma grenades</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether plasma grenades bounce off of a player that is 
            currently using Armor Lock, instead of sticking to them and killing them.</dd>
         <dt>Enable Active Camo modifiers</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether the "Active Camo Energy Curve" values are used.</dd>
         <dt>Must have an Energy Sword to sword-block</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether players can survive an Energy Sword attack by using 
            a melee attack with any weapon.</dd>
         <dt>Enable full-auto Magnum</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether players can fire the Magnum full-auto by holding 
            the trigger.</dd>
         <dt>Precision Weapon Bloom</dt>
            <dd>Magnify or diminish the amount of bullet spread and reticle "bloom"

         <dt>Armor Lock Damage Drain</dt>
            <dd>Taking damage while using Armor Lock can drain Armor Lock's remaining 
            energy.</dd>

            <dd>The maximum amount of Armor Lock energy that can be drained by 
            incoming damage.</dd>
         <dt>Active Camo Energy Curve Min</dt>
            <dd>Scale Active Camo's energy usage.</dd>
         <dt>Active Camo Energy Curve Max</dt>
            <dd>Scale Active Camo's energy usage.</dd>
         <dt>Magnum Damage</dt>
            <dd>A multiplier applied to the Magnum's damage output.</dd>
         <dt>Magnum Fire Delay Multiplier</dt>
            <dd>A multiplier applied to the delay between firing consecutive shots 
            with the Magnum.</dd>
