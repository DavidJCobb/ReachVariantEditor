      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Synchronize with Team</dt>
            <dd>Controls whether player respawn timers run independently or synchronize 
            with those of their teammates.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn with Teammage (unverified)</dt>
            <dd>Testing is pending.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn at Location (unverified)</dt>

         <dt>Respawn on Kills</dt>

            <dd>Controls the maximum number of times a player can die before they are 
            unable to respawn again. The value "unlimited" exists in place of zero (i.e. 
            to reach it, decrease the value to "1 life" and then decrease it again).</dd>
         <dt>Team Lives per Round</dt>
            <dd>Presumably controls the maximum number of lives available to a team as 
            a whole; testing is pending. The value "unlimited" exists in place of zero (i.e. 
            to reach it, decrease the value to "1 life" and then decrease it again).</dd>
         <dt>Respawn Time</dt>
            <dd>The baseline delay between dying and respawning, for all players.</dd>
         <dt>Suicide Penalty</dt>
            <dd>The number of seconds added to the delay on a player's next spawn, if 
            they died by their own hand or were killed by a level boundary.</dd>
         <dt>Betrayal Penalty</dt>
            <dd>The number of seconds added to the delay on a player's next spawn, if 
            they have killed a teammate.</dd>
         <dt>Respawn Time Growth</dt>
            <dd>TBA</dd>
         <dt>Loadout Camera Time</dt>
            <dd>A delay between the start of the match and the first time players spawn 
            in. This delay encompasses the initial black screen with a scoreboard, the 
            fade in, and the display of the Initial Loadout Camera view (during which 
            time players can select a loadout).</dd>
         <dt>Respawn Traits Duration</dt>
            <dd>Controls how long players have Respawn Traits after respawning.</dd>
