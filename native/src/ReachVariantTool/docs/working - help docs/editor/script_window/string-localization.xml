      <p>
         When editing strings in a game variant, it is usually possible to provide
         translations into multiple languages. (In some cases, this feature is not
         available due to technical limitations in the game variant file format.)
         Additionally, there is a "Library" button that you can click to access the
         <b>localized string library</b>, a collection of translations pulled from
         official Bungie content &mdash; both existing game variants and the base
         map files.

         The string library is shown below.

         The lefthand column has a list of all available strings, along with a 
         search box.

         The righthand column allows you to preview the text of a given string in 
         any supported language. Additionally, some strings allow you to specify 
         options. As an example, the "x Points" string allows you to substitute in 
         any number, with plurals handled for each language.

         Several strings also have more detailed descriptions, which may contain 
         notes about the context in which the string was used, or information 
         specific to certain languages. For example, the "Turn Clock" string in 
         Portugese is "Chess Clock," and this is noted in the description.
