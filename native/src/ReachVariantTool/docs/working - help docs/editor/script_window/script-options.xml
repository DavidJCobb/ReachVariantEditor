      <p>
         The <b>scripted options</b> page allows you to define Custom Game options 
         for the script, whose values can be changed in the in-game menus. Options 
         can be added and reordered, and options that are not actively used by the 
         gametype script can be deleted.

      <p>
         The fields available to edit for each option are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Option Name</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the option name.</dd>
         <dt>Option Description</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the option 
            description.</dd>
         <dt>Option Type</dt>
            <dd>The option type. An "enum" is an option that has up to eight 
            distinct values, each of which can be named. A "range" is an option 
            that can be configured as a slider. Note that the game itself doesn't 
            support displaying and customizing ranges in-game.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         For range options, you can customize the minimum, maximum, and default 
         values.
      </p>
      <p>
         For enum options, you can select the default value, and the fields available 
         to edit for each value are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Value Name</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the value name.</dd>
         <dt>Value Description</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the value 
            description. In Halo: The Master Chief Collection, this will be 
            displayed instead of the option description when the user is 
            mousing over this value.</dd>
         <dt>Value</dt>
            <dd>The integer value associated with this, um, value. If the user 
            chooses this value for the option, then this is the integer that 
            the gametype script will "see."</dd>
