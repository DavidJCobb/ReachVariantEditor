   <title>Scripted HUD Widgets</title>

      <p>
         The <b>scripted HUD widgets</b> page allows you to define script-accessible 
         HUD widgets that can be displayed and customized by the script.

      <p>
         The only attribute of a HUD widget that you can customize here is its position 
         on-screen; the text and other visuals are set by the script code and can even 
         be changed on the fly (though they have to be the same for all players). If 
         two HUD widgets have the same position, they will not overlap; they will be 
         positioned adjacent to each other in an intelligent fashion. However, some 
         widget positions will overlap standard HUD elements such as the shield bar 
         or motion tracker.
