   <title>Scripted HUD Widgets</title>
   <body>
      <p>
         The <b>scripted HUD widgets</b> page allows you to define script-accessible 
         HUD widgets that can be displayed and customized by the script.

      <p>
         The only attribute of a HUD widget that you can customize here is its position 
         on-screen; the text and other visuals are set by the script code and can even 
         be changed on the fly (though they have to be the same for all players). If 
         two HUD widgets have the same position, they will not overlap; they will be 
         positioned adjacent to each other in an intelligent fashion. However, some 
         widget positions will overlap standard HUD elements such as the shield bar 
         or motion tracker. Additionally, if a gametype tries to display more than two 
         widgets to the same player at the same position, only two of them will actually 
         be shown by the game, preferring ones earlier in the widget list.

         Most of the page is taken up by an image which displays where the HUD widget 
         will appear. This preview only shows the selected widget, and it assumes that 
         only the selected widget is showing.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note that the bottom-right widget position is only suitable for "meter" widgets 
         &mdash; that is, those which use the "set_meter_params" function. Widgets in 
         this position can display icons and meters, but not any text. The widget will 
         appear below the hardcoded scoring UI.
