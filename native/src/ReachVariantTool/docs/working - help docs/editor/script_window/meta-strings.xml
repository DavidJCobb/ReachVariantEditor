      <p>
         The <b>metadata strings</b> page allows you to edit text used as metadata for 
         the gametype.

      <p>
         The fields available to edit are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>A localized name for the game variant.</dd>
         <dt>Description</dt>
            <dd>A localized description for the game variant.</dd>
         <dt>Category</dt>
            <dd>A localized name for the category. This isn't used in Halo: The Master Chief 
            Collection. Presumably, in the Xbox 360 release of <i>Halo: Reach</i>, this 
            would be used to name an extended category ID if a game variant used one.</dd>
         <dt>Generic Name</dt>
            <dd>In Halo: The Master Chief Collection, this is used to generate a localization 
            key for the game variant filename. If a certain flag is set inside of the game 
            variant file, then its embedded title will be ignored in favor of a localization 
            key of the form <code>$HR_GVAR_GenericNameHere</code>. However, ReachVariantTool 
            always clears that flag in order to ensure that you can actually set a game 
            variant's name.</dd>
