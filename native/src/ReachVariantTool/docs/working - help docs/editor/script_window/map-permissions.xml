         The <b>map permissions</b> page allows you to control what base maps the 
         player is allowed to play this game variant on.

         This list can function as a whitelist, limiting the player to using specific 
         maps, or a blacklist, preventing the player from using specific maps. The 
         usual setup is to use a blacklist that doesn't actually have any maps checked.
