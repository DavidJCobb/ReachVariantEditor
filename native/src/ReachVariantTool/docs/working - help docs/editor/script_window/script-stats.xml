      <p>
         The <b>scripted stats</b> page allows you to define custom scoreboard stats 
         that can be used by the gametype script. Note that as of this writing, Halo: 
         The Master Chief Collection does not display these stats anywhere.

         The fields available to edit for each set of player traits are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the traits name.</dd>
         <dt>Format</dt>
            <dd>Controls how the stat's value is displayed on the scoreboard.</dd>
         <dt>Sort Order</dt>
            <dd>Determines whether and how players are sorted within the scoreboard 
            by this stat's value.</dd>
         <dt>Group Players by Team</dt>
            <dd>Unknown.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         Scripted stats can be used to show gametype-specific statistics on the 
         scoreboard, such as the number of times a player has armed and detonated a 
         bomb in Assault. They are also a useful means of persisting data across 
         rounds, so that a script can know what happened in the previous round(s).
