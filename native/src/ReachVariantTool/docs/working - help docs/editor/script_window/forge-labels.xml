      <p>
         The <b>Forge labels</b> page allows you to edit the Forge labels defined 
         for a game variant. You can add labels, reorder them, and delete any labels 
         not in use by the gametype script.

      <p>
         The fields available to edit for each Forge label are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>The name to use for a Forge label; the label matches all objects 
            with this label assigned. This is optional; a label with no name string 
            can be used internally by the gametype script to rapidly access all 
            objects on the map that meet specific criteria.</dd>
         <dt>Object Type</dt>
            <dd>If enabled, the label also matches all objects of this type.</dd>
         <dt>Team</dt>
            <dd>If enabled, the label also matches all objects on this team. This 
            may not behave the way you expect; for example, in FFA gametypes, it 
            seems like most or all objects, including projectiles, are on Team 1.</dd>
         <dt>Number</dt>
            <dd>Yet to be determined.</dd>
         <dt>Map Must Have At Least</dt>
            <dd>The minimum number of labeled objects that must exist on the map 
            in order for this game variant to be considered compatible.</dd>
      </dl>
