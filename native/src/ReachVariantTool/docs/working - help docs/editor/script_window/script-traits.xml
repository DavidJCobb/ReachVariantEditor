      <p>
         The <b>scripted traits</b> page allows you to define player trait sets 
         for the gametype, which can be viewed and configured in-game. You can 
         add and reorder traits, and you can delete any traits that are not 
         actively in use by the gametype script.

         The fields available to edit for each set of player traits are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the traits name.</dd>
         <dt>Description</dt>
            <dd>The <a href="string-table">string</a> used for the traits 
            description.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         To edit the actual player traits themselves, use the main window.
