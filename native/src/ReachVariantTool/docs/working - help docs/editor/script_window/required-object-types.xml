   <title>Required Object Types</title>

      <p>
         The <b>required object types</b> page allows you to determine which object 
         types must be implemented on a map in order for a game variant to be compatible.
      </p>

      <p>
         If any object type in this list has its checkbox checked, then <i>Halo: Reach</i> 
         will not allow players to play this game variant on any base map that does not 
         define that object. For example, if the "Covenant Bomb" object is checked, then 
         players will not be able to play the game variant on any map other than Breakpoint, 
         which is the only one to define the Covenant Bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
         The list includes several object type names that aren't actually implemented in 
         <i>Halo: Reach</i>, such as the Chopper, Brute Shot, and other <i>Halo 3</i> 
         leftovers. No, there's no way to magically spawn these in the game.
