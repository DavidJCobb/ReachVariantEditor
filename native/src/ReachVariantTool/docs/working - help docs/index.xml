         language. You can use the sidebar to navigate the documentation. Some entries 
         in the sidebar can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the grey buttons on

         ReachVariantTool is an unofficial tool that can be used to edit <i>Halo: Reach</i> 
         game variants. A "game variant" is a collection of saved settings for multiplayer 
         matches; for example, if you have fun playing Capture the Flag with 200% jump 
         height with your friends, you can save those settings as a "game variant."

         <i>Halo: Reach</i> introduced an interesting and powerful new feature: instead of 
         having all game modes hardcoded like in past games, game modes use a scripting 
         language... and the script code is stored in each individual game variant. When 
         you save your Capture the Flag with 200% Jump Height game variant, you're not 
         just saving a little post-it note that says "double jump height" on it; you're 
         saving <em>an entire separate copy of Capture the Flag's code</em>... and 
         ReachVariantTool can modify that code. You can make entire new game modes.
