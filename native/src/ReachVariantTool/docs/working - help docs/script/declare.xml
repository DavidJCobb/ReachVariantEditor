      <p>
         Variable declarations allow you to specify a variable's networking priority and its 
         initial value. They aren't required &mdash; you can use a variable straightaway, 
         without declaring it &mdash; but because Megalo's default variable networking priority 
         can't survive host migrations, you'll probably want to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
         Variable declarations look like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
         declare SOME_VARIABLE
         declare SOME_VARIABLE = SOME_NUMBER
         declare SOME_VARIABLE with network priority SOME_PRIORITY
         declare SOME_VARIABLE with network priority SOME_PRIORITY = SOME_NUMBER
      </pre>
      <p>
         When specifying the variable to declare, you are allowed to use an <a href="alias">alias</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Only number and timer variables can be given initial values. These values can be any 
         number except for another variable. If you do not specify an initial value (or if you 
         don't declare the variable at all), then the initial value used is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
         All variable types except for timers can have a networking priority set. The network 
         priority values are:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>default</dt>
            <dd>The meaning of this value is unclear. Testing has established that a variable's 
            value will be lost after a host migration if its network priority was the default.</dd>
         <dt>low</dt>
            <dd>Testing has established that low-priority variables can survive a host migration.</dd>
         <dt>high</dt>
            <dd>Testing has established that high-priority variables can survive a host migration. 
            If you wish to display a player variable in the UI, it must be high-priority.</dd>
         <dt>local</dt>
            <dd>Variables with this network priority aren't sent over the network at all.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         Declaring a variable multiple times generates a compiler warning if the declarations 
         don't conflict ith each other or contain redundant information (e.g. multiple initial 
         values), or a compiler error otherwise.
