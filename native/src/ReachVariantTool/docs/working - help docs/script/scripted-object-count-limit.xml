   <title>Scripted object count limit</title>

      <p>
         Objects are capable of having variables attached to them &mdash; numbers, timers, and 
         references to teams, players, and other objects. However, the game needs someplace to 
         actually store the values of these variables.
      </p>
      <p>
         In practice, the game only makes enough room for 512 objects' worth of <dfn>scripted 
         object data</dfn> (256 on Xbox 360). This data includes nested variables, but also 
         includes a variety of properties and options that can be set on objects via scripts. 
         If there already exist 512 objects (256 on Xbox 360) with scripted object data, any 
         attempt to set any of this data on a 513th object (257th on Xbox 360) will silently fail.
      </p>
      <p>
         The following operations may create scripted object data for an object, depending on 
         what objects they're called on. This list is based on reverse-engineering of the game 
         executable, and should be considered best-effort, not definitive.
