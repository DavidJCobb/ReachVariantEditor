   <blurb>A type of object that can exist in the game world.</blurb>
   <description>
      <p>
         This type represents kinds of objects that can exist in the game world. It is 
         roughly analogous to "base forms" in Skyrim.

            Headshot-capable, with a scope for long-range combat and a fire rate appropriate for

            <dd>A human weapon: a massive particle beam cannon which can fire four rounds. It has a long

            <dd>&unused-object; A development leftover from Halo 3: a single-occupant Covenant vehicle armed with 
            two cannons that fire explosive shells. The front of the vehicle was equipped with a

            <dd>An UNSC space vehicle capable of housing a single occupant. Sabres are armed with a chaingun and lock-on missiles, and can perform evasive maneuvers similarly to a Banshee. In addition, they can rotate about the roll axis, allowing them to turn sideways or upside-down mid-flight. This maneuverability comes at a cost, however: like Banshees, Sabres have a constant forward thrust, but a Sabre moves faster and takes damage upon any impact with the environment.</dd>

            releasing an EMP upon deactivation which disables vehicles and strips shields, all at
