         <h1>team.score</h1>

            <p>
               This property provides access to a team's score. Note that a team's score 
               <em>is not</em> the total score of its players. Rather, both players and 
               teams are entities that are able to "have points."
            </p>
            <p>
               Suppose a match has two teams, Red and Blue, and no one (players or teams) 
               has any points. If you set each team's score to 1, and then set a Red Team 
               player's score to 1, then Red Team will be in the lead.
            </p>
         <h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
for each team do
   if current_player.biped != no_object then
      --
      -- If the player has a biped on the map, then they must be alive.
      --
      current_player.team.score += 1
   end
end</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
   <li><p>
            It may seem strange for teams to have distinct score values from their players, 
            but there is a use for it. Suppose you're playing Assault, and a player arms 
            the bomb and then quits before the bomb detonates. Normally, when a bomb 
            detonates, a point is awarded to the player who planted it, but in this case, 
            since the player quit, the point will be awarded to the team itself. A similar 
            thing occurs in Stockpile, if a collected flag was placed into a team's goal 
            by a player who quit or (perhaps accidentally) by an enemy of that team.
