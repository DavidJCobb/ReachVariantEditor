   <blurb>Contains temporary variables.</blurb>
   <description>
      <p>
         The <var>temporaries</var> namespace contains temporary variables, a feature 
         backported from Halo 4 to the Halo: The Master Chief Collection version of 
         Halo: Reach. Gametypes that use these variables are incompatible with the 
         original Xbox 360 version of Halo: Reach, and with MCC versions that predate 
         the mid-July 2023 update.
      </p>
      <p>
         You should not refer to temporary variables directly (e.g. <code>temporaries.number[<var>n</var>]</code>); 
         this namespace is provided for use by ReachVariantTool's decompiler. You are 
         encouraged to instead use <a href="script/alias.html">allocation to aliases</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
         Temporary variables do not need to be <a href="script/declare.html">declared</a>, and 
         cannot be given an initial value or a networking priority. Declaring a temporary 
         variable is a warning (and the declaration is ignored) unless you specify an 
         initial value or networking priority, in which case it's an error.
      </p>
      <p>
         Temporary timers don't exist. (How would they? Temporaries aren't meant to 
         last for longer than some individual task during a single frame; they can't 
         be used to track things across time.)
      </p>
      <p>
         When you write scripts using MegaloEdit, the official Megalo editor by Bungie 
         and 343 Industries, you can use a larger number of temporary variables 
         than in ReachVariantTool. Both tools face the same limit on how many 
         temporary variables can exist, but if you hit that limit in MegaloEdit, 
         its compiler will "spill over" into any <a href="ns_global.html">global variables</a> 
         that you haven't already used, repurposing them as temporary variables. 
         ReachVariantTool is unable to do this due to technical limitations in its 
         design.
