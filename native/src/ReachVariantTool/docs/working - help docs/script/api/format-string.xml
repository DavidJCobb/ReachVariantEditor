      <p>
         Halo: Reach's scripting engine supports the display of "format strings." A 
         format string can be a simple piece of text, but it can also include little 
         placeholders that will automatically be replaced with other values (the 
         format string "parameters") when the string is displayed. Up to two 
         additional parameters can be provided after the format string itself.
      </p>
      <p>
         A percentage sign (<code>%</code>) marks the start of a placeholder; the 
         content after it determines the type of placeholder to use, and in some 
         cases, the options to use for the placeholder. If you want to write an 
         actual percentage sign in text, you must type <code>%%</code>. Using a 
         placeholder symbol incorrectly (including by writing just one <code>%</code> 
         symbol) will cause Halo: Reach to refuse to display your string.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
         Here's an example of how to use format strings: this code, taken from Slayer, 
         displays the number of points needed to win if the game variant has a score 
         limit.
      </p>
      <pre>
         for each player do
            if game.score_to_win != 0 and game.teams_enabled == 1 then 
               current_player.set_objective_text("Kill players on the enemy team.\r\n%n points to win.", game.score_to_win)
            end
            if game.score_to_win != 0 and game.teams_enabled == 0 then 
               current_player.set_objective_text("Score points by killing other players.\r\n%n points to win.", game.score_to_win)
            end
            if game.score_to_win == 0 and game.teams_enabled == 1 then 
               current_player.set_objective_text("Kill players on the enemy team.")
            end
            if game.score_to_win == 0 and game.teams_enabled == 0 then 
               current_player.set_objective_text("Score points by killing other players.")
            end
         end
      </pre>
      
      <h2><a name="persistent">Persistent strings</a></h2>
      <p>
         Some functions treat format strings as <dfn>persistent</dfn>. This means that 
         those particular strings can't be used to display "transient" variables &mdash; 
         that is, any variable whose value will likely be reset before the frame is over, 
         like the <a href="ns_unnamed/current_player"><var>current_player</var></a> or 
         <a href="ns_unnamed/killer_player"><var>killer_player</var></a> variables.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <a href="ns_game/show_message_to">game.show_message_to</a> function is an 
         example of a non-persistent string:
      </p>
      <pre>
         for each player do
            if current_player.number[0] == 1 then
               game.show_message_to(all_players, "%s won the game!", current_player)
               current_player.number[0] = 0
            end
         end
      </pre>
      <p>
         When that function runs, it will immediately substitute your format string 
         parameters into the format string, and it will pass the resulting text to 
         the kill feed, which remembers that text. This means that for the case above, 
         your kill feed message will always display whatever player was 
         <var>current_player</var> at the time the function was called.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <a href="widget/set_text">widget.set_text</a> function is an example of 
         a persistent string:
      </p>
      <pre>
         script_widget[0].set_text("%s won the game!", global.player[0])
      </pre>
      <p>
         When that function runs, it doesn't <em>immediately</em> substitute out your 
         placeholders. Instead, it remembers the format string, and it remembers which 
         variables you passed as format string parameters &mdash; not the variables' 
         <em>values</em>, but the variables themselves. Every frame, the HUD widget 
         will take the format string and substitute out <code>%s</code> for the name 
         of <em>whatever player</em> happens to be the one referred to by <var>global.player[0]</var> 
         on that frame. If that variable's value is changed, the HUD widget will update 
         in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is why transient variables can't be used with persistent strings: their 
         values don't last through a whole frame, so when the HUD widget (or object 
         waypoint or similar UI) redoes the format string substitution, the variables 
         won't have the values you intended.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you want players to see their own names (or variables) in a persistent 
         string, then use variables like <a href="ns_unnamed/local_player"><var>local_player</var></a>.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Placeholder codes by type</h2>
      <style>
      .default-result{display:block;border-top:1px solid #AAA;padding:.25em 0 0 0}
      </style>
      <p>
         Different placeholder codes are intended to format different kinds of 
         information. If you pass a value of the wrong type (e.g. passing a 
         player variable for a placeholder meant for numbers), then you'll see 
         a default value which varies depending on the placeholder code.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you don't pass any value at all, then the placeholder will be 
         cut out of the string, but the string should still display as long as 
         the placeholder itself was valid.
      </p>

            <dd>
               All of these codes print the number normally, as you would expect.
               <div class="default-result">
                  <b>Default result:</b> <code>0</code>

      </dl>
      
      <h3>Unknown</h3>
      <dl>
         <dt>%c</dt>
            <dd>Sometimes, this fails as an error and prevents the string from being 
            displayed. Other times, it produces a line break followed by the number 
            25. Notably, in ASCII, the number 25 is used to encode the percentage sign.</dd>

               <p>Seems to always produce <code>1</code>, no matter what you pass in.</p>
               <p>
                  In the C and C++ programming languages, these codes are used to 
                  format integers. You can put additional settings between the 
                  percentage sign and the number, in order to pad the number to 
                  a certain length using spaces or zeroes. Those settings work 
                  here, but they always act as if you passed in the number 1; 
                  <code>%03d</code>, for example, always produces <code>001</code>.

      </dl>
      
      <h3>Decimal number</h3>
      <p>
         Format codes exist for decimal numbers, but it's not clear why. None of 
         the variable types available to Megalo are decimal numbers, and these 
         codes don't work for timers (except when timers have special meanings 
         for them).
      </p>
      <p>
         These codes seem to be meant for double-precision floating-point values.
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>%a</dt>
            <dd>
               Prints the number in hexadecimal (base-16) format.
               <div class="default-result">
                  <b>Default result:</b> <code>0x0.0000000000001p-1022</code>
               </div>
            </dd>
         <dt>%A</dt>
            <dd>
               Same as <code>%a</code>, but the result uses all-caps.
               <div class="default-result">
                  <b>Default result:</b> <code>0X0.0000000000001P-1022</code>

                  <b>Default result:</b> <code>0.000000e+00</code>
               </div>
            </dd>
         <dt>%f</dt>
            <dd>
               Prints the number out to six significant figures.
               <div class="default-result">
                  <b>Default result:</b> <code>0.000000</code>

         <dt>%g</dt>
            <dd>
               Prints the number out to exactly as many decimal points as is 
               necessary if the number has fewer than six significant digits 
               before the decimal point and fewer than four after; otherwise, 
               uses scientific notation like <code>%e</code> does.
               <div class="default-result">
                  <b>Default result:</b> <code>0</code>
