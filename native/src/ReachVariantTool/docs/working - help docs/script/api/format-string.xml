         Halo: Reach's scripting engine supports the display of "format strings." A 
         format string can be a simple piece of text, but it can also include little 
         placeholders that can be replaced with other values when the string is 
         displayed. Up to two additional values can be provided after the format 
         string itself.
      </p>
      <p>
         The known format codes are:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>%n</dt>
            <dd>Placeholder for a number.</dd>
         <dt>%s</dt>
            <dd>Placeholder for any other value that should display as text.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         Variables with the following types can be substituted into the string:
      </p>
      <dl>
         <dt>number</dt>
            <dd>Displays normally.</dd>
         <dt>object</dt>
            <dd>Displays the name of the object; however, most objects don't have 
            actual names defined and will show "unknown".</dd>
         <dt>player</dt>
            <dd>Displays the player's Xbox LIVE Gamertag.</dd>
         <dt>team</dt>
            <dd>Displays as a blank, zero-length value.</dd>
         <dt>timer</dt>
            <dd>Displays minutes and seconds, separated with a colon and each padded 
            to two digits.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         Here's an example of how to use format strings: this code, taken from Slayer, 
         displays the number of points needed to win if the game variant has a score 
         limit.
      </p>
      <pre>
         for each player do -- round card
            if game.score_to_win != 0 and game.teams_enabled == 1 then 
               current_player.set_round_card_title("Kill players on the enemy team.\r\n%n points to win.", game.score_to_win)
            end
            if game.score_to_win != 0 and game.teams_enabled == 0 then 
               current_player.set_round_card_title("Score points by killing other players.\r\n%n points to win.", game.score_to_win)
            end
            if game.score_to_win == 0 and game.teams_enabled == 1 then 
               current_player.set_round_card_title("Kill players on the enemy team.")
            end
            if game.score_to_win == 0 and game.teams_enabled == 0 then 
               current_player.set_round_card_title("Score points by killing other players.")
            end
         end
      </pre>
