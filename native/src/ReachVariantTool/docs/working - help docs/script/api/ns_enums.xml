         <description>
            <p>
               This enum contains values that can be returned by the 
               <a href="script/api/object/actions/get_orientation">object.get_orientation</a> 
               function. Each value indicates which of the object's local vectors most 
               closely matches world up.
            </p>
            <p>
               In layman's terms: imagine a cube enclosing the object, and imagine that the 
               cube rotates to match the object. Now imagine an arrow sticking directly out 
               of each side of the cube. Each arrow represents a "local direction" for the 
               enclosed object: local up, local forward, local backward, and so on. The 
               <a href="script/api/object/actions/get_orientation">object.get_orientation</a> 
               function tells you which of these local directions is pointing "up." Note that 
               by design, you can't check the object's heading; you essentially can only 
               react to pitch and roll rotations.
