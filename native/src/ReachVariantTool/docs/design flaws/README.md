I've gotten significantly better at working with C++ since I made ReachVariantTool. Coming back to it with more experience &mdash; particularly with metaprogramming &mdash; I can see that while it was very good for what it was, and for the level of experience I had at the time, it is by my current standards relatively messy and a challenge to maintain. Fixing its design flaws would in many cases require a total rewrite of the program, and leaving them as is means that new features built around them are similarly flawed.

It seems worth documenting some of the problems. This folder is not an exhaustive list; there are other flaws that I am aware of, but haven't been able to organize and document as of yet.
