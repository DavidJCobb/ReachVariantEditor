               <p>
                  This function attaches the context object to a given basis object.
                  The context object will be moved to the basis object's position plus
                  the supplied offset before the attachment is performed; an argument
                  allows you to control whether the offset is relative to the rotation
                  of the basis object. Note that the context object will <em>not</em>
                  be rotated before the attachment is performed.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Attached objects effectively take on Phased physics; their movement
                  cannot be impeded by other objects. Additionally, if objects are
                  attached to a non-solid basis, such as a Flag Stand, then they
                  themselves stop being solid; and if they are attached to an invisible
                  basis, such as a Hill Marker, then they stop being visible altogether.
                  Note that non-solid vehicles still offer entry prompts.
               </p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3><a name="anchoring">Anchoring</a></h3>

               <p>
                  Objects appear to be attached to the nearest node on a basis object's
                  3D model, with no apparent distance limit. For example, this piece
                  of code would create a skull and anchor that skull to a Warthog's
                  steering wheel:
               </p>
               <pre>
<span class="keyword">alias</span> some_warthog = ...
<span class="comment">--</span>
global.object[0] = some_warthog.place_at_me(skull, none, none, 0, 0, 0, none)
global.object[0].attach_to(some_warthog, 0, 0, 20, relative)</pre>
               <p>
                  Even though the skull is attached to a point two full Forge units
                  above the Warthog, it still attaches to the nearest node in the
                  Warthog's 3D model, which happens to be the steering wheel. If a
                  player enters the driver's seat and turns to the left or right,
                  the skull will move and rotate in an arc above them, in synch with
                  the steering wheel. Different offsets would anchor the skull to
                  other nodes in the Warthog's 3D model, such as its tires.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Most objects have a node defined at their origins, and that can
                  be used to avoid this behavior: spawn an extra object, have it
                  copy the rotation of the basis, and then attach it to the basis
                  with offset (0, 0, 0); then, attach the rest of your objects to
                  that extra object.
               </p>
            <h3><a name="vehicle-attachment">Effects of attaching vehicles to other objects</a></h3>

               <p>
                  Attaching a vehicle to an object will lock the vehicle in place. The
                  pilot will be able to look around at any angle, but the vehicle will
                  not turn, and the vehicle's weapons fire will be constrained to the
                  weapon's turn radius.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Attached vehicles will not play any entry/exit animations (e.g. a
                  Banshee's canopy opening and closing), but will instantaneously
                  update to any animations' end states when detached (e.g. a Banshee's
                  canopy will instantly snap open or closed as appropriate).
               </p>
               <p>
                  Bipeds in an attached vehicle will lose most animations. Passengers'
                  hands may move slightly (and incorrectly) while reloading their weapon;
                  though they have no reloading or weapon swap animations, appropriate
                  sounds still play, and they cannot fire their weapons while the reload 
                  animation would be taking place. Some animations have player model
                  jiggle physics; these jiggle physics remain functional even though
                  the rest of the animation does not. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  If a Banshee is performing an evasive maneuver at the moment it is
                  attached, the maneuver will end instantly; no such maneuvers can be
                  performed once the vehicle is attached.
               </p>
            <h3>Other notes</h3>
<ul>
   <li><p>
               If either of the context or <var>basis</var> objects are <var>no_object</var>, 
               or if both are the same object, then this function does nothing.
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               Armor Abilities equipped by players are an exception to normal
               attachment behaviors. If you detach an Armor Ability from a player's
               back, you can move it around or attach it without unequipping it from
               that player; however, the Armor Ability will automatically detach
               itself every frame. (Verified for Armor Abilities worn by Monitors,
               but not tested for Armor Abilities worn by Spartans and Elites.)
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               Attaching a biped to an object will lock the biped in place. If the
               biped is controlled by the player, they will be able to turn but not
               to move, and their first-person legs will desynch from their upper
               body.
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               When a biped enters a vehicle, it is considered attached to that
               vehicle. Scripts cannot attach it to something else while it is in
               the vehicle. Weapons being carried by a biped are expected to behave
               similarly.
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               If something is attached to a Monitor biped, it will bob up and down
               in synch with that biped's animation. All of a Monitor's nodes,
               including the one with the animation, are located at the same
               model-relative coordinate, and the one with the animation is the one
               that is found by the game engine when performing an attachment.
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               It appears that attaching an object to <var>no_object</var> and then
               detaching it will teleport it to the world origin. On Forge World,
               this is a point out by the canyon's beach.
            </p></li>
   <li>
               <p>
                  If a player's biped is attached to an object that is destroyed on
                  contact with a player, such as a landmine or powerup, then that
                  player's camera will be locked to a consistent but unusual place;
                  on Boneyard, this is a point in space far outside the map. Using
                  Theater will show that the object appears to still exist, and that
                  the affected player's biped is frozen in place inside of the
                  object. The player's camera will remain fixed exactly in this
                  spot even if they were in third-person view at the time they were
                  affected.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In this state, the player can switch weapons, drop a detached
                  turret if they are carrying one, fire their weapons, and throw
                  grenades. All of these actions will occur relative to the player's
                  "true" position at the object they were attached to, rather than
                  at their camera position. Projectiles will fire roughly in the
                  direction that the player is looking, but the yaw angle may be
                  mismatched: it will be a combination of the direction that the
                  player was looking just prior to the attachment, and the amount
                  by which they have turned to the side after being attached,
                  rather than matching their current camera yaw angle. The player
                  will not be able to interact with objects near their "true"
                  position; a vehicle next to them, for example, will not show
                  button prompts for entry, and pressing the button to enter a
                  vehicle anyway will not work.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The object to which the player was attached may activate some
                  of its on-contact behaviors; landmines don't detonate, and
                  Active Camo Powerups aren't destroyed and don't give the
                  player camo, but the latter cause the player to constantly
                  experience the sound loop that plays when camo is active.
               </p>
               <p>
                  These are the results of a local, single-player test. The
                  networked behavior is not known.
               </p>
            </li>
   <li>
               <p>
                  If the player is attached to an Armor Ability, and if this
                  would normally cause them to pick the Armor Ability up, then
                  they will experience the same anomalies as if they were
                  attached to a weapon that is destroyed on contact. They will
                  not be able to use the Armor Ability during this time.
               </p>
            </li>
   <li>
               <p>
                  If the player is attached to a weapon right as they equip it
                  (e.g. an unarmed player being attached to a weapon, such that
                  they touch the weapon and equip it as they are attached),
                  then they will equip the item normally rather than being
                  attached to it... but they will also be launched with
                  considerable force — possibly enough to break a map's
                  boundaries.

                  If the player is attached to a grenade, and if this causes
                  them to pick the grenade up, then the player will be unable
                  to move, their animations will freeze, and their camera will
                  be anchored to the spot the grenade used to be in.
