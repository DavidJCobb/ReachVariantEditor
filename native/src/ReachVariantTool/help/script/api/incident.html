         <h1>Incident</h1>

      <p>
         This type represents events that can occur in a match. You can 
         <a href="script/api/ns_unnamed/actions/send_incident.html">"send" incidents</a> to 
         the game engine in order to award medals, play announceover voiceovers, and 
         more. Note that while many of these incidents correspond to medals and some 
         correspond to Achievements, sending them won't necessarily award those medals 
         or Achievements; among other things, incident responses can be configured on 
         a per-game-mode basis, with distinctions between Matchmaking and Custom Games.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</i> may respond to incidents in its own 
         ways, which may not be evident through examination of <i>Halo: Reach</i>'s 
         game files. 343 Industries seems to be mindful of this; for example, when a 
         Freeze Tag round begins its Neutral Flag phase, 343i imitates the effect of 
         the <code>announce_ctf_start</code> incident (by manually writing a message 
         to the kill feed and playing the announcer sound) instead of sending it 
         directly. In general, if an incident that seems purely cosmetic also seems 
         to have been intended for a particular purpose, it may be best to use it 
         primarily for that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
         Internally, incidents and their effects are defined within each *.MAP file. 
         The <code>ingd</code> (incident globals definition) tags define the incidents 
         themselves. When an incident has an event name listed, that name is one of 
         the "Engine Events" listed in the map's <code>gegl</code> (game engine globals) 
         tag. Some incidents only exist to facilitate "spree" medals; for example, the 
         <code>wingman_spawn</code> incident doesn't do anything in and of itself, but 
         the <code>wingman_5x</code>, <code>wingman_10x</code>, and <code>wingman_15x</code> 
         incidents all trigger automatically when <code>wingman_spawn</code> has occurred 
         a certain number of times.

         <dt>player_kills_spartan</dt>
            <dd>Examination of the game's incident definitions suggests that this 
            incident triggers automatically when an Elite player kills a Spartan 
            player. If this incident fires five times in a row, it automatically 
            triggers the <code>player_kill_spartan_achieve</code> incident.</dd>

            awarded for playing Firefight as an Elite and killing five Spartans. 
            The Achievement could theoretically be earned in Multiplayer, but it 
            is Matchmaking-only, and it's not known whether the 
            <code>player_kills_spartan</code> incident is a <em>requirement</em>
