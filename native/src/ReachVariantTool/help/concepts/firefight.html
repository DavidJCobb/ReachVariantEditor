         <h1>Firefight</h1>

      <p>
         Firefight is a predominantly PvE mode wherein a team of player-controlled Spartans 
         must face off against waves of Covenant NPCs. The Spartans must survive to the end 
         of the game, and in some cases must also defend a set of power generators placed 
         on the map. Players can also join the Covenant team as Elites, adding a PvP 
         dimension to the game mode.
      </p>
      <p>
         Whereas Campaign is a more narrative PvE mode, Firefight has an arcade aesthetic, 
         with the UI and announcer clearly indicating the match progression.
      </p>
      
      <h2><a name="overall-match-flow">Overall match flow</a></h2>
      <p>
         When editing a Firefight game variant, it is worth knowing the general structure 
         of a Firefight match, especially in comparison to a standard Multiplayer match.
      </p>
      <p>
         A Multiplayer match is divided into "rounds." Gameplay begins when the round 
         begins and ends when the round ends. A round may end when a time limit runs out, 
         when the objective is complete, or when the Score to Win is reached.
      </p>
      <p>
         Firefight matches are divided very differently, and the term "round" has an 
         entirely different meaning. The basic unit of a Firefight match is the "wave:" a 
         period of time which begins when six squads of NPC enemies are spawned on the map 
         (or delivered by dropships), and which ends when those enemies are killed. Each 
         group of five waves is a "round." Three rounds, followed by an optional "bonus 
         wave," form a "set."
      </p>
      <p>
         The Multiplayer concept of "rounds" still exists in Firefight, but in Firefight, 
         they are called "turns." A turn encompasses an arbitrary number of sets, rounds, 
         and waves. A turn ends when the Spartans are defeated, when the wave limit is 
         reached, or when the turn time limit is reached (though <i>Halo: Reach</i>'s UI 
         does not normally allow players to set a turn time limit). Spartans are considered 
         defeated if they are all dead and unable to respawn due to a lack of extra lives, 
         or (when applicable) if their Generators are destroyed.
      </p>
      
      <h3><a name="match-flow-details">Match flow details</a></h3>
      <p>
         If Weapon Drops are enabled, then they will occur at the start of each round. 
         Spartans will also receive extra lives at the start of each round after the 
         first.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each round consists of one Initial Wave, three Main Waves, and one Boss Wave, for 
         a total of five waves. Each wave consists of six squads of enemies, for a total 
         of thirty squads per round.
      </p>
      <p>
         When a new wave begins, the respawn timers for any currently-dead players will be 
         reset, and the game will select an enemy squad type to spawn. If dropships are 
         enabled, then six squads of that type will spawn aboard them, and the dropships 
         will enter the map to deliver the squads; otherwise, the squads will spawn in a 
         map-specific manner (typically just appearing out in the open, though Corvette 
         spawns them behind locked doors instead).
      </p>
      <p>
         All waves except for the last wave in a round will end when all but three enemies 
         are dead; the last wave in a round will end when all enemies are dead. (During the 
         last wave in a round, the last five surviving enemies will have their exact 
         locations shown to the Spartan team via waypoints, though those waypoints will 
         not appear until the enemies have landed from their dropships.) If a wave failed 
         to spawn any enemies, whether because the selected enemy squad type was None or 
         because the selected enemy squad type is not supported on the current map, then 
         the wave will end after roughly seven to nine seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note that if dropships are enabled for a wave, then the end of a wave will always 
         be delayed until after the dropships have fully exited the map.
      </p>
      <p>
         When a Boss Wave is completed, the Spartans will be awarded extra lives &mdash; 
         specifically, one extra life per Spartan; the Hero medal will be awarded at this 
         time, if applicable. All dead players will respawn, and all living players will 
         have their shields fully restored. 
      </p>
      <p>
         When the last round in a set is concluded, Firefight will attempt to begin the 
         bonus wave. Unlike most waves, the bonus wave does not end when the enemies it 
         spawns are eliminated. Instead, the bonus wave will only end when its duration 
         elapses or if all Spartans are dead at the same time. Moreover, if the bonus 
         wave is configured to use dropships, then the dropships will remain in the map, 
         continually spawning and dropping new enemies, until the wave ends, at which 
         point they will depart. Once the bonus round ends, all enemies that were 
         spawned as part of the bonus round will die instantly (though enemies that 
         spawned from map hazards will not).
      </p>
      <p>
         Examination of map scripts suggests that Sudden Death activates if any generators 
         on the map are still online, with some sort of additional check related to whether 
         they're locked. It also seems as if generators cannot be locked while Sudden Death 
         is active.

      <h3><a name="network-test-1">Is it possible to remake Network Test 1?</a></h3>
      <p>
         For those who aren't aware, Network Test 1 was a game variant available to players 
         during the <i>Halo: Reach</i> beta. It resembled a normal Multiplayer mode, but in 
         reality, it was actually a Firefight variant intended to test the game's lockstep 
         networking model. It was effectively a 3v3 PvP-only Generator Defense match. So, 
         is it possible to recreate Network Test 1 in the final game using modded settings?
      </p>
      <p>
         Yes, but not very well. Network Test 1 used a map script boolean variable called 
         <var>alpha_sync_slayer</var> to disable the lion's share of Firefight's 
         functionality; in the release version of <i>Halo: Reach</i>, this variable is set 
         to false. This means that it's impossible to disable the normal set/round/wave 
         progression through game variant content alone.
      </p>
      <p>
         (The same variable also forcibly respawns all Health Packs on the map every 
         thirty seconds, so that's another behavior that can't be recreated.)
      </p>
      <p>
         Setting all enemy squad types to None and disabling all waves' dropships would 
         be the obvious thing to try, but remember that dead players' respawn timers reset 
         on each new wave. The default respawn time is ten seconds, and empty waves with 
         no dropships end after nine seconds, so any players who die will be unable to 
         respawn until the next round. Leaving dropships on ensures that waves last long 
         enough to allow most players to respawn, although players who die too close to 
         the end of a wave will still have their respawn timers reset one time. This, of 
         course, still means that the announcer will constantly call out new waves, 
         rounds, and sets. It also means that weapon drops will appear much too frequently, 
         as the game engine just blows through rounds literally as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
         A less obvious thing to try would be taking advantage of the bonus wave as an 
         arbitrary period of time during which no new waves will occur. However, it is not 
         possible to trigger the bonus wave early, which means that it would take roughly 
         two minutes to even reach it. Moreover, the bonus wave will still end early if 
         all Spartans are ever dead at the same time, even if the Iron Skull is disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
         Engineers are probably the least obstrusive enemy type, since they have no actual 
         AI implemented and will typically sit motionless on the ground at their spawn point. 
         If they are used, then players can simply ignore them and fight each other.
      </p>
      
      <h3><a name="teams">Teams</a></h3>
      <p>
         Firefight and Multiplayer use the exact same options for teams. However, Firefight's 
         handling of these options is very different.
      </p>
      <p>
         If teams are enabled, then the only thing they will affect is which set of spawn 
         locations are available to a player. The species that a player spawns as will 
         influence everything else, including which loadout palette they have access to, 
         which pool of lives they use, and their alliance status with Covenant NPCs.
      </p>
      <p>
         If teams are disabled, then all players will be treated as part of the "defense" 
         team, and will be enemies with Covenant NPCs, no matter what species the players 
         spawn as. However, Elites will neither gain nor lose points for killing Covenant 
         NPCs.
      </p>
      <p>
         If teams are disabled, or if players are on extended teams such as Team 3, then 
         they will not see a round title card. However, they will still hear a mission 
         briefing voiceover corresponding to whatever faction they are allied with.
