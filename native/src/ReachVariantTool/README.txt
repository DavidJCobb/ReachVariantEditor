ReachVariantTool by DavidJCobb

--

A GUI tool for editing settings in game variants. It does not offer access to 
Megalo script data at this time (aside from the values of script-defined options). 
The tool can load Multiplayer and Forge variants, but not Firefight or Campaign 
variants. (I'm not sure that Campaign variants are even used in MCC.)

The tool was built primarily for working with Master Chief Collection-era files. 
It should hopefully work well enough with Xbox 360-era files (I've tested a few).
