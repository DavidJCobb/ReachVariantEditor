                  If this function is passed a valid biped, it forces the context player to 
                  abandon control of their current biped and take control of the passed-in 
                  biped. If this function is not passed a valid biped, then it does nothing. 
                  Either way, the player's old biped is not deleted from the map; it simply 
                  becomes an inactive NPC.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
               <p>
                  Holograms do not <a href="script/api/object/conditions/is_of_type.html">test</a> 
                  as being Spartans, Elites, or Monitors. However, they are still valid bipeds; 
                  passing a Hologram to <code>set_biped</code> will place the player in control
                  of the biped.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Holograms spawn with a primary weapon only, with a full magazine regardless
                  of how much ammo the caster had left. If a Hologram's player traits don't
                  prevent it from taking damage, then it will be killed when it expires. Any
                  weapons dropped by a Hologram will be deleted instantly; this includes any
                  cases of a Hologram swapping a held weapon for one on the ground. Any items 
                  that a Hologram is carrying at the time it dies or expires will be deleted. 
                  Holograms can use Armor Abilities, but the Hologram ability has no effect 
                  for them because the "hologram" bipeds don't have a "Hologram Unit" set.
               </p>
               <p>
                  If a player is forced to control their own Hologram, this will affect their
                  respawns. If the Hologram dies while under control, they will not be placed
                  back into their original body; instead, they will respawn normally (if the
                  Hologram was killed), or they will instantly appear in a new body such that
                  there is never any frame on which the player has no biped (if the Hologram
                  expires due to its natural timer).
               </p>
            </li>
   <li>
               <p>
                  If necessary, you can spawn a biped inside of a vehicle by spawning the 
                  biped, forcing a player to control it, forcing the player into the vehicle, 
                  and then returning the player to their original biped. However, if the 
                  player is spawned on the map at the time, then there will be a brief cut to 
                  black for that player; they will notice the loss of control. If you need to 
                  spawn NPC bipeds into vehicles, it is best to do this during the initial 
                  loadout camera or while a player is waiting to respawn, if possible.
               </p>
               <p>
                  NPC bipeds that occupy vehicles will behave the same as players who are not 
                  providing any inputs; for example, an NPC-occupied Banshee will fly forward 
                  automatically.
               </p>
            </li>
   <li><p>
               By default, Monitors spawn with an invisible Focus Rifle, and are capable of 
               picking up weapons, grenades, and Armor Abilities. Monitors can fire any 
               ranged weapon and can use any Armor Ability that does not depend on character 
               model animations (e.g. they can use Active Camo but cannot Sprint); they 
               cannot melee or throw grenades, though they will make melee sounds. Equipped 
               Armor Abilities will be visible on the Monitor's body, displaying their 
               holographic icons as if they were still lying around waiting to be picked up.
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               Once a Megalo-spawned biped has been controlled by a player, it will take on 
               that player's appropriate armor or team color and (if it's a Spartan) its 
               voice will match the player's chosen gender regardless of its own gender 
               presentation. Moreover, in FFA games, the biped will appear allied to the 
               last player who controlled it, even if it appeared as an enemy to them 
               beforehand.
            </p></li>
   <li>
               <p>
                  You can force a player into a biped while the initial loadout camera is playing, and they 
                  will be able to play early. However, if you do this, the player will hear a constant shrill 
                  beeping, like the ring of an alarm clock. It appears that this beeping plays for every 
                  frame that the player spends in control of a biped, if that player has never controlled a 
                  "natural" biped before; the solution is to ensure that the player has spent at least one 
                  frame in control of a normally-spawned biped before forcing them into a new biped.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I was able to identify the beeping sound; it is defined in the following tags. These tags 
                  seem to have been intended for the Missile Pod, a weapon present only in <i>Halo 3</i>; however, 
                  a search for Missile Pod gameplay videos on YouTube failed to turn up anywhere this exact 
                  sound plays.
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>lsnd\sound\weapons\missile_launcher\tracking_locking\locking\loop</li>
                  <li>snd!\sound\weapons\missile_launcher\tracking_locking\locking\loop</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  I was unable to locate anything that could use the tag. If the usual community tools for 
                  browsing *.MAP files allow you to search for anything that uses a tag, I haven't managed 
                  to find that feature.
               </p>
            </li>
   <li><p>
               Suppose a player is given control of a biped and later has that control revoked. If at 
               some point afterward you try to rotate the biped and give the player control over it, all 
               on the same frame, then the rotation will fail: the biped will continue to aim in the last 
               direction the player was aiming when they lost control over it. This can cause issues in 
               cases where you want to switch a player between multiple bipeds, seamlessly; the solution 
               is to rotate the biped on one frame and then wait 'til the next to actually force the 
               player into it.
            </p></li>
   <li><p>
               Forcing the player into a dead biped will cause their camera to point toward the ground, 
               and lock their camera more-or-less at ground height. They will be unable to move, pick up 
               weapons, or otherwise interact with the environment. As long as the body remains present, 
               the player will not respawn; if the biped was set by scripts to never be garbage-collected, 
               then the player is effectively trapped.
