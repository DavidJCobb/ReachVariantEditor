         <h1>Under the hood</h1>
      <p>
         This article describes the basics of how Megalo code is compiled and stored in a saved 
         gametype. You don't need to know any of this in order to write Megalo scripts; this 
         should be considered advanced knowledge.
      </p>
      
      <section>
         <h2>Basic structure of a script</h2>
         <p>
            Megalo scripts are organized into <dfn>triggers</dfn>, which map roughly to blocks of 
            code in a script. The code itself consists of <dfn>conditions</dfn> and <dfn>actions</dfn> 
            which are executed in sequence when the game engine executes the trigger as a whole. 
            Triggers have additional data allowing them to specify their overall type (e.g. what 
            kind of <a href="script/for.html">for</a>-loop, if any, they are, and what Forge label they act 
            on) and what <a href="script/events.html">event</a> they handle.
         </p>
         <p>
            In order to nest a block of code, the game compiles the inner block as its own trigger 
            separate from the outer block; the inner block is marked as a "subroutine" block, which 
            distinguishes it from a top-level trigger so that the game won't blindly execute it 
            when scanning through the trigger list. Then, the outer block has a "call" action 
            compiled in: this action refers to another trigger by index and directs the game to 
            execute that trigger's contents.
         </p>
         <p>
            ReachVariantTool abuses this implementation of nesting in order to offer <a href="script/function.html">user-defined functions</a>: 
            we compile the function's body as an independent trigger that has been marked as an 
            inner trigger, and we use the "call" action to... well, call it. You could think of 
            a user-defined function as an inner block that's nested under multiple outer blocks, 
            existing in multiple places at once.
         </p>
      
         <h3>Storage</h3>
         <p>
             Gametype script code uses a struct-of-arrays approach for storage. Rather than 
             physically locating conditions and actions inside of the data for their containing 
             trigger, Halo: Reach instead stores a list of every condition in the script, a list 
             of every action in the script, and a list of every trigger in the script.
         </p>
         <p>
            Triggers contain a data structure that is, internally, called an "action scope." 
            This data structure contains the indices of the trigger's first condition and first 
            action, as well as the number of conditions and actions inside of the trigger: the 
            trigger defines its contents as slices of the condition and action arrays. This 
            approach on its own would not allow conditions and actions to be interleaved; 
            Bungie accomplished that by having each condition specify the index (within the 
            containing trigger, not the overall list) of the action it precedes.
         </p>
         <p>
            (This is all part of the overall design for game variant data: nothing inside of a 
            game variant is heap-allocated, and there don't appear to be any internal pointers. 
            All lists are stored in fixed-size memory regions. This extends even to the string 
            table: the max uncompressed size is 0x4C00 bytes, and so there's a region that 
            large within the in-memory game variant struct.)
         </p>
         <p>
            It would hypothetically be possible to "overlap" triggers: if two triggers start 
            with identical opcodes, then they could share those opcodes. This is not an easy 
            optimization to implement, however, and because of the way opcode interleaving 
            works, I don't expect that there would even be many opportunities to use it. An 
            even more challenging optimization would be to overlap triggers whenver it is 
            possible to do so, such as by having one trigger share the <em>middle</em> of 
            some other trigger, or having a trigger share identical conditions and actions 
            with different other triggers. (There are other data values on conditions that 
            would need to be dealt with as well; see the next section.)
         </p>
         
         <h3>Execution</h3>
         <p>
            In order to execute a trigger, the game loops over every action inside the trigger. 
            For each action, we loop over all conditions that we haven't looped over before, and 
            that come before the current action. If those conditions, in sum, fail, then we stop 
            trigger execution; otherwise, we execute the current action. Conditions, then, act 
            as early-returns from the current block. There are no "if" blocks in Megalo; rather, 
            there are bare blocks which contain conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
            The qualifier "in sum" here refers to the fact that conditions can be linked with 
            "and" relationships or, alternatively, with "or" relationships. Conditions each have 
            an "or group" value, an arbitrary integer; consecutive conditions with the same "or 
            group" value are considered "or"-linked. Conditions fail in sum if any "and"-linked 
            condition fails, or if all of a set of "or"-linked conditions fail.
         </p>

}</pre>
         <p>
            Because conditions act as an early-return mechanism for their containing block, they 
            don't always require a separate block of their own; a condition's influence runs to 
            the end of its containing block. If you wish to have some sequence of actions where 
            only the middle few actions are conditional, however, then you must split that sequence 
            of actions into a nested trigger, which will limit those conditions' influence.
         </p>
      
         <h3>Inlined triggers</h3>
         <p>
            The mid-July 2023 update to Halo: The Master Chief Collection backported a number of 
            scripting features from Halo 4 to Halo: Reach. One of these is the <code>begin</code> 
            action, which allows one to nest a block of script code without having to create an 
            entire new trigger for it (thereby avoiding the limit on how many ordinary triggers 
            a game variant can contain).
         </p>
         <p>
            The implementation is simple. The action's sole parameter is an action scope — 
            the data structure that triggers use to identify what conditions and actions they 
            contain. In other words, the action scope for the nested block is inlined directly 
            into the action used to execute that block.

      <section>
         <h2>References</h2>
         <p>
            There are five kinds of values to which one can define a reference: integers, objects, 
            players, teams, and timers. These can be split into two categories: numeric references 
            (though MegaloEdit uses the term "custom") and handle references, the latter so named 
            because Halo: Reach's engine generally uses handles rather than pointers for working 
            with objects, players, and teams.
         </p>
         <p>
            <dfn>Explicit handle references</dfn> are single values — enums, which indicate 
            specific, globally-accessible handles; for example, <code>current_object</code>, 
            <code>local_player</code>, and all global and temporary handle variables in Megalo.
         </p>
         <pre lang="c++">
enum class explicit_object_handle : int8_t;
enum class explicit_player_handle : int8_t;
enum class explicit_team_handle   : int8_t;

union explicit_handle_union {
   int8_t untyped = -1; // "none"

   explicit_object_handle object;
   explicit_player_handle player;
   explicit_team_handle   team;
};</pre>
         <p>
            Handle reference operands in Megalo, then, resemble the following, using object 
            handles as an example:
         </p>
         <pre lang="c++">
enum class object_reference_kind : uint8_t;

class object_reference {
   public:
      object_reference_kind  kind; // like a tagged union's tag
      explicit_handle_union  top_level;
      std::optional&lt;uint8_t&gt; member_index;
};</pre>
         <p>
            If the operand refers directly to an explicit object handle, then the <var>kind</var> enum 
            will indicate this, and the <var>top_level</var> field will specify which handle is being 
            referred to, and the <var>member_index</var> field will be absent. If the operand refers to 
            an object that is the member of some other handle, then the <var>kind</var> enum will indicate 
            that; the <var>top_level</var> field will specify the handle, and the <var>member_index</var> 
            field will specify which object handle member is being referred to.
         </p>
         <p>
            Complicating matters slightly is the fact that properties are also represented in this 
            system. If the operand is a reference to a player's biped, then this is indicated via 
            the <var>kind</var>; the <var>member_of</var> and <var>target_index</var> fields hold 
            the same values that they would for a <code>player_reference</code> referring to that 
            same player.

            Numeric references are slightly different. First, I'll illustrate this with timers:

         <pre lang="c++">
enum class timer_reference_kind : uint8_t;

class timer_reference {
   public:

};</pre>
         <p>
            If the operand is a reference to a built-in timer, like the game's round timer, then 
            this is indicated via the <var>kind</var>; neither of the other fields are present 
            in the serialized data. If the operand is a reference to a globally-scoped timer, then 
            this is indicated via the <var>kind</var>, the <var>member_of</var> is absent from the 
            serialized data, and the <var>target_index</var> specifies which timer is being used. 
            If the timer is a member of some other object, then all three fields are used.

            Integer references are essentially the same, except that they can also refer to an 
            integer constant — a signed 16-bit value:
         </p>
         <pre lang="c++">
enum class integer_reference_kind : uint8_t;

class integer_reference {
   public:
      integer_reference_kind kind; // like a tagged union's tag

         int16_t constant;
         struct {
            explicit_handle_union member_of;

         <p>
            As with handles, integer property references on handle references (e.g. read-access 
            to a player or team's score) are indicated by the <var>kind</var> enum; <var>member_of</var> 
            and <var>target_index</var> hold the same values that their corresponding fields on 
            handle references, <var>top_level</var> and <var>member_index</var>, would use to refer 
            to the handle on which the property is being accessed. (Perhaps, then, it might even 
            be a good idea to separate out the latter two fields into a struct, and add that as a 
            union member in <code>integer_reference</code>?)
         </p>
         
         <h3>Temporary variables</h3>
         <p>
            The mid-July 2023 update to Halo: The Master Chief Collection backported a number of 
            scripting features from Halo 4 to Halo: Reach. One of these is <dfn>temporary variables</dfn>. 
            Their implementation differs between numeric and handle references, naturally. Temporary 
            integer variables are identified by a <var>kind</var> value and a <var>target_index</var>. 
            Temporary handle variables are identified as new explicit handle references — that 
            is, new values in the <code>explicit_object_handle</code>, <code>explicit_player_handle</code>, 
            and <code>explicit_team_handle</code> enumerations shown above.
         </p>
         <p>
            Temporary variables don't need to be declared within the gametype metadata; the game 
            always has room for them; they always exist. When you declare a temporary variable 
            in MegaloEdit, the official editor for Halo: Reach gametypes, it handles this by 
            just compiling in an assignment to zero-or-none. It automatically allocates temporary 
            variables based on block scoping, similarly to <a href="script/alias.html">allocation to aliases</a> 
            in ReachVariantTool. One important difference between the editors is that MegaloEdit 
            is capable of "spilling over" into unused global variables if a script runs out of 
            temporary variables. MegaloEdit can do this because all non-temporary variables must 
            be declared before all script code, so even with a single-pass parser, it always knows 
            which variables are used and which are not. ReachVariantTool, by contrast, also uses 
            a single-pass parser but allows variable declarations (and implicit instantiation: 
            using an undeclared variable automatically declares it) anywhere in the script, and 
            so when ReachVariantTool encounters an allocation-to-alias, it can't know for sure 
            that any given global variable will <em>stay</em> unused through the rest of the 
            script, and so can't safely spill extra temporaries to globals.
         </p>
         <p>
            (And in case it needs to be said: when MegaloEdit spills to globals, it still uses 
            block-scoping. Once a spilled temporary variable goes out of scope, the global used 
            to back it is considered free for use by any temporaries that spill later on.)
         </p>
      
         <h3>ReachVariantTool implementation</h3>
         <p>
            ReachVariantTool does not make any distinction between numeric and handle references, 
            because at the time I didn't realize there was any such distinction to make. All five 
            reference types are handled uniformly. The components of a reference operand (called 
            a "variable" operand in RVT) are classified based solely on their types, and not on 
            their meanings. This is an unfortunate design flaw arising from an incomplete understanding 
            of Megalo, and it makes ReachVariantTool's code for references harder to follow and 
            reason about.
         </p>
         <p>
            The <var>kind</var> field is in ReachVariantTool called the operand's "scope" value. 
            The <var>top_level</var> field on handle references and the <var>member_of</var> 
            field on numeric references are treated uniformly and called the "which" value. The 
            <var>member_index</var> field on handle references and the <var>target_index</var> 
            field on target references are treated uniformly and called the "index."
         </p>
         <p>
            Scope-values are implemented as <code>VariableScopeIndicatorValue</code> instances 
            stored in arrays (one for each reference type); instances effectively serve as 
            annotations for the values of the <var>..._reference_kind</var> enums. The enum 
            values are annotated with:

                        For references to indexed data objects, like Megalo-defined scoreboard 
                        stats or Custom Game options, this is a functor that can be used to get 
                        a type-erased pointer to the data object in memory, i.e. a pointer to 
                        the scoreboard stat definition or Custom Game option definition.

                        ReachVariantTool allows users to reorder most indexed data options: 
                        Custom Game options, scoreboard stats, and similar are defined and 
                        edited through the GUI and can be rearranged. The naive approach to 
                        this would be to have all script operands store raw indices, and 
                        iterate through the entire script to update every operand whenever 
                        the user reorders something. The approach ReachVariantTool takes is 
                        to have these indexed data objects all inherit from a common base 
                        class that tracks its own index within its containing list (i.e. 
                        the <var>n</var>-th scoreboard stat <em>knows</em> that it is the 
                        <var>n</var>-th scoreboard stat), and have script operands store 
                        pointers (typed to the base class) to the indexed data objects. When 
                        we go to save the gametype to a file, the operand can simply ask the 
                        indexed data object for its index and then serialize that index.
                     </p>

            Which-values are implemented as <code>VariableScopeWhichValue</code> instances stored

            Indexes are implemented as simple integers. When the reference is to an indexed data 
            object, they are paired with smart pointers that manage refcounts on the indexed data 
            objects (another feature of the base class described above, used to allow end users to 
            delete indexed data objects if they aren't in use by the script).

         <h2>ReachVariantTool's compiler</h2>
         <p>
            ReachVariantTool uses a mostly-single-pass compiler for its Megalo dialect. Parsing 
            and compilation are done as a single step, and the resulting grammar is 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar">context-dependent</a> 
            rather than <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">context-free</a>. 
            There is not any formal grammar; rather, the grammar is entirely a side-effect of 
            how the parser is implemented.</p>
         <p>
            (This is not a terribly good way to design or implement a scripting language, but 
            in my defense, I had never come across Robert Nystrom's excellent book 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html"><i>Crafting Interpreters</i></a> 
            before.)
         </p>
         <p>
            The compiler reads your script source code and instantiates objects which represent 
            the basic elements of a script: blocks (including user-defined functions), comparisons, 
            statements, aliases, and user-defined enums. The script is represented as a tree structure 
            wherein blocks are branch nodes, comparisons act as annotations to blocks, and statements 
            and aliases are leaf nodes contained within a block. Additionally, during parsing, the 
            compiler retains its own set of unowned pointers to keep track of what aliases, user-defined 
            functions, and user-defined enums are in scope. (User-defined enums are tracked only by the 
            compiler and do not exist within the block hierarchy; however, each enum has a pointer to 
            the block in which it was defined, which allows enums to be block-scoped: we know when to 
            delete them.)
         </p>
         <p>
            Statements are compiled into Megalo opcodes and operands as they are read. Blocks are not 
            compiled immediately as they're read; rather, top-level blocks are compiled once their end 
            is fully parsed. This is necessary in order to properly handle if-blocks.
         </p>
         <p>
            Variable references are parsed as they are seen. ReachVariantTool only stores enough data 
            to reliably identify a valid variable reference — so, fields for a top-level variable, 
            nested variable, property, and accessor; as well as fields for integer constants. Invalid 
            variable references (e.g. references nested too deeply) can't be retained at all, which 
            also means that strict typing cannot be enforced for them. For example, ReachVariantTool 
            cannot emit additional errors if you try to compare <code>global.object[0].number[1].player[2]</code> 
            to <code>no_team</code>.
         </p>
         <p>
            The parser has a limited backtracking capability: handlers for keywords and other language 
            constructs can create a backup of its current position, and then restore that backup, 
            essentially allowing the compiler to rewind to places it's already been. This is used for 
            things like overload resolution (i.e. <code>game.send_incident</code>): because parsing 
            and compiling are done as a single step, the only way to tell which overload the user is 
            invoking is trial-and-error. Function calls are compiled by finding an opcode that has a 
            matching name and has been designated as a function, and attempting to compile each of the 
            passed-in arguments into operands for that opcode.
